# hello-world
This is not a test. 

 My life is like a Rube Goldberg machine. I cannot explain why. I like to read. I like science-fiction. I am an ugly bastard that likes to play the guitar and listen to punk and ambient electronic music or maybe classical music. You know too much already. I am so selfish to keep on living. Thank-you for reading this unless you are going to use this against me later.
